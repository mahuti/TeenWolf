### Requires: 
- Pos module https://github.com/mahuti/Pos-Module

### Uses: 
- snap: standard video snaps
- boxart: 2d boxart  
- wheel: wheel logos 
- cartridge: cartridge art is all front-facing art except for NES and Atari which use images of the spine of the cartridge (just the label)

I used Hyperspin & Emumovies assets for videosnaps, flyers, etc. Other versions may not fit as well as those. 

### Features: 
- Themes is scalable to any size or orientation
- Does not use a spinning wheel (but does use wheel logos)
- Realistically scaled console & controller images 
- Image/Names are based on US console versions
- Works for multiple emulators
- Posters in background can be replaced with your own images (or hidden)
- Screen glow, screen bloom, and scanlines can be adjusted or hidden
- Game titles and playtime can be shown or hidden
- Scales to any size

### Usage Instructions: 
There are 2 methods: 

#### Version 1. 
Name your romlists exactly the same as the names shown in the following console list and the theme will change styles automatically based on the display's assigned romlist. (Sorry, Attractmode doesn't tell me what emulator you're trying to use, so all I can do is change the visuals based on romlist name)

##### Required List Names
- Atari 2600
- Intellivision
- Nintendo NES
- Nintendo SNES
- Nintendo 64
- Sega Genesis
- Sony Playstation
- ScummVM
- Generic PC
- Generic TV

#### Version 2.
If you don't want to use specific romlist names, duplicate the layout (you can name it whatever you want) and set the "Selected System" option to the specific visual style you want. This is also handy if you'd like to set other layout options differently per-display as well.
